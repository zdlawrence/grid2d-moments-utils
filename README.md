# grid2d-moments-utils

## Requirements ##
grid2d_moments_utils.py only requires numpy and scipy

The jupyter notebook examples require
- jupyter
- numpy
- scipy
- xarray
- cartopy
- matplotlib

## To Dos ##
- Provide another example notebook using this code for image characterization tasks with comparisons to scikit-image (to demonstrate the applicability of these techniques for more general purposes) and include resources on relevant computer vision topics (e.g., Hu moments).

## Questions you might ask ##

- **Why do you not provide functions for calculating cartesian coordinates of different 2D map projections?** Because this is Cartopy's job, and it is very good at doing so! There's no need to roll your own functions since you can easily have cartopy translate between the map projections of your choice.
- **Why does your calc_2d_moments function not calculate area?** It's primarily to keep the code as general as possible without being misleading. The problem with calculating area is that it depends on the underlying coordinate system. Since these functions were written with geophysical applications in mind (where a user may be remapping from one set of coordinates to another), I decided it was better to leave the calculation of area to the user. As an exampe, suppose one converts a set of data from a spherical latitude/longitude grid to a north polar stereographic grid. The area of a region in the stereographic coordinates is not equal to the area of the same region if it were calculated in its original spherical coordinates, since the stereographic projection does not preserve area. In the polar vortex example notebook, I provide examples of how you can easily calculate area in the cartesian coordinates
